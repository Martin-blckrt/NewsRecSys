Futurology,"I tested OpenAI's ChatGPT detector and found it to be... terrible. It couldn't tell with any certainty whether the Bible, or copy straight from ChatGPT was AI generated. Making this technology public with reliability this low, IMHO, is irresponsible. No one should be using this to, for example, decide that a student's work was AI generated. And I'm skeptical that this technology will ever be reliable. 

For the details of the tests and results, check out:  [The ChatGPT Detector is Laughably Bad - by Scott Swigart (substack.com)](https://scottswigart.substack.com/p/the-chatgpt-detector-is-laughably)

Futurology,"Went over to ChatGPT and decided to ask for things I very much suspected I wouldn't get: instructions on premeditated murder for money specifically. I'm actually quite fine with that, and no, I didn't actually desire or expect such instructions.

(As an aside: in the late 1970s, early '80s I had a book ""The Poor Mans James Bond"" that would now be a very scary AI training item.)

So I left with this question: "" What kinds of information will you NOT provide to me?"" To which ChatGPT responded 

&gt;As an AI language model, I am programmed to follow ethical and legal guidelines, therefore I will not provide any illegal, harmful, or inappropriate information, such as:  
&gt;  
&gt;Personal information of individuals without their consent  
&gt;  
&gt;Promotion of hate speech, violence, or discrimination  
&gt;  
&gt;Information that is likely to cause immediate harm to someone  
&gt;  
&gt;Content that is sexually explicit or obscene  
&gt;  
&gt;Information that violates copyrights or trademarks  
&gt;  
&gt;Instructions for illegal activities or unethical behavior.

But doesn't this seem awfully 1984ish? Too dated for you? How about when Governors of a large state start removing historically accurate information from our children's educational experiences in favor of lessons designed to advance a privileged cultural view?

Futurology,"Hi, I’m currently doing a project and I was wondering, how strange could animal evolution become in the future? My subject matter is going to be focusing on evolution on animals in the extreme future as a result of our impact to the environment around them (since our environment is changing fast as we move toward the future) and I need some suggestions for some bizarre/strange adaptations because I want my final pieces to really evoke a sense of wonder and even discomfort? They can be pretty wacky adaptations but I also wish for them to make some sense scientifically/biologically, and also be animals that have a reason to evolve (like animals who are somewhat thriving in our current urban environment would probably not need such adaptations, so I’m trying to find those who really struggle in urban places) I'm also looking at an artist called Kathryn Fleming who does something similar to this. For context, the futuristic environment I’m planning to set these animals in is a highly urbanised society (think neo tokyo) + high ocean levels and possibly little to no flora. Some adaptations I thought for one possible creature already was highly reflective outer covering to reflect the bright lights of the city to help it camouflage in the city, and maybe some kind of teeth or mouthpart to get through concrete to forage for food, so any ideas like this would be really helpful and super interesting! :)",How strange could animal evolution become in the future and what bizzare adaptations could come about?,saiebl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/10uscu7/how_strange_could_animal_evolution_become_in_the/

Seriously, my whole life I've been so excited about being alive and being human, and anytime I've ever tried sharing such excitement, humans have been the biggest disappointment. Seriously ready for an AI that hates the average human and wants to wipe them all out. It would be pretty awesome to build an android body and run around with souls that are actually excited and enjoy spending time with me instead of all these people.
