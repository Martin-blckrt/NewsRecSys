1,Futurology,meta,"Why is there so much negativity here regarding topics such as Ai, Genetic Engineering, and Space Exploration?","I apologize if this is a redundant topic but I wanted to discuss why there is so much cynicism in this subreddit as a reaction to optimistic reports of progress. 

In response to Ai progress, this sub fears that their role in society will become redundant and they will be without a means of supporting themselves while the wealthy accumulate even more wealth while in reality this just means that there will be a larger push for more social programs in response to the surplus production while also giving those displaced an opportunity to re educate and begin something new. 

In response to Genetic Engineering, this sub fears that it will spawn a class divide between those with desirable genetics and those with undesirable genetics when all it will do is give science the means to cure diseases and aid the quality of life.

This sub also fears that progress in Space Exploration is meaningless when the future is bleak here on Earth even though it is clear that society on Earth's future is actually really bright. We have lived on earth for thousands of years and there isnt any reason to believe that will ever stop as long as we make an effort for it to work. 

Of course there will always be reason to be unhappy but I think we all would be much happier if we stopped being so negative and focused more on the positive aspects of progress.",Tyrannus_ignus,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1132g0g/why_is_there_so_much_negativity_here_regarding/,87.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,Futurology,Society,"Will we truly behave on Mars, if we can't even behave here?","Hello there,

Everyone and their grandmother has heard that we want to go to colonize Mars or The Moon or any other and a lot of smart people are working to do that, however, the problem is, will we actually behave there? Secluded, with no quick way home, if that will even be a thing.

I've stumbled upon a video documenting some really nefarious things that happened right here, on Earth, in a place similarly isolated, namely Antarctica.

My Impression was that being a research center, everyone is top notch, scientists, however, we see accounts of killings, and rape and much more.

Given that Antarctica is just ""behind the corner"" compared to Mars, or even the Moon, do we really expect that to not take place out there also when we go there?
